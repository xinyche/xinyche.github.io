# Words to Emma:

>Be yourself!



# Words to Us:

>Your children are not your children.
>They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
>They come through you but not from you.
>And though they are with you, they belong not to you.
>You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
>For they have their own thoughts.
>You may house their bodies but not their souls,
>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,
>Which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite.
>And He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
>Let your bending in the archer's hands be for happiness,
>For even as He loves the arrow that flies,
>So He loves the bow that is stable.
>
>                                                         --Khalil Gibran
