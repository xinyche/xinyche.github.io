# Words to Emma:

人生的意义，是学会和自己相处。

人生最重要的能力，是取悦自己。

愿你时刻保持悦己之心！

允许一切，如其所是！

Be yourself!

When you know, you know!

Gradually, then suddenly!

# Words to Us:

Your children are not your children.

They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.

They come through you but not from you.

And though they are with you, they belong not to you.

You may give them your love but not your thoughts.

For they have their own thoughts.

You may house their bodies but not their souls,

For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,

Which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.

For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.

The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite.

And He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.

Let your bending in the archer's hands be for happiness,

For even as He loves the arrow that flies,

So He loves the bow that is stable.

它是学识，见识和胆识的综合体

它是获取美的能力

也是感受生命和生活的能力

悦纳自己，是一生的旅程
