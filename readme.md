# Words to Us:

>Your children are not your children.

>They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.

>They come through you but not from you.

>And though they are with you, they belong not to you.

>You may give them your love but not your thoughts.

>For they have their own thoughts.

>You may house their bodies but not their souls,

>For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,

>Which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.

>You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.

>For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.

>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.

>The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite.

>And He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.

>Let your bending in the archer's hands be for happiness,

>For even as He loves the arrow that flies,

>So He loves the bow that is stable.




>知识改变命运

>并不是学历改变命运

>也是感受生命和生活的能力
